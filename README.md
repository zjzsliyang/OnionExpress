- Overview of your progress on system design and a description of implement platforms and frameworks.
- Architecture Refinement
  - Present a platform-dependent architecture with refined overall structure.
  - Provide a list of subsystems and interfaces.
  - Demonstrate interface specification in details with one or several samples between your system and external systems, such as the e-commerce website, 3rd party messaging system, map services and so on.
  - Select one subsystem as an example to specify the its interfaces in details.
- Select any two analysis mechanism mentioned in your analysis model, find suitable solutions in your implementation platform and then provide detailed description of the corresponding design mechanisms.
- Design two use case realizations by incorporating the design mechanisms and refined architecture.
- Progress on prototyping.
