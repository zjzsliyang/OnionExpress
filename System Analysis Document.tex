\chapter{Introduction}
Onion Express\textregistered\ is a system built for logistic companies, which provides them with a solution to logistics tracking, goods packing, goods distribution, after-sales management, data storage, information processing, etc.

\section{Purpose}
These days as B2C business is increasing rapidly, the growth of logistics business is also remarkable. The enormous market demand brings logistics companies opportunities as well as the challenge. Facing such kind of condition, this project is aimed at improving the efficiency of field personnel and customer satisfaction of a logistics company by building a cross-platform system.

\section{Definitions}
As Jobs has ever said, “People don't know what I really want at all, until your products are in their eyes”. This project is specially designed for an independent logistics companies like UPS. The business scope is limited within China. To be more precise, the express is only available in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai at the beginning. Temporarily private orders are not covered in the business scope, which means the express company corporates with e-commercial companies only with the cash-on-delivery express or normal express. The system focuses on logistics service without regard to O2O, bulk cargo or self-support e-business. Timing express might be expanded in future.

\section{System Overview}
The actors in the system are classified as \emph{Postman, E-business, Customer service, Customer} and \emph{Agent}. \emph{Customer} and \emph{Agent} are generalized as Receiver. The \emph{Postman} has access to this system only on mobile devices while \emph{Customer} has access both on browsers as well as mobile devices. \emph{E-business} offers orders periodically. \emph{Customer service} helps to deal with tasks cannot be done only by the system.\\
Web application and iOS application provide different functions for different users to enhance user experience and have some humanization design(e.g. using different colors to mark tasks as reception or delivery in postman’s app). Besides basic functions, the system also provides some advanced functions, like printing invoices. Different offline payment methods are supported. And the customer’s telephone number is hidden to protect his/her privacy.\\
The postman is equipped with a multifunctional special device, when the customer receives his/her package, he/she can use this device to pay by card and can also press thumb on it to sign digitally, besides, the device helps collect postman’s GPS location accurately.\\
The system considers all the 8 scenarios, including sending the package, paying for the product, signing the package and so on. To integrate the system, two scenarios are added. One is creating the orders, at the beginning of the entire flow. Another is dealing the order manually, to reduce errors caused by the system and handle other unanticipated situations. That can improve the stability of the system and in consideration of the relatively small scale of users in the early stage, robot customer service is not necessary. It can be taken into consideration when the business is expanding to a certain stage.\\
This project also designs several user interface mock-ups on the website and on mobile devices. Core functions are exhibited in these mock-ups, for example, the dispatch list interface.\\
Nonfunctional requirements and further explanations on security, performance, data storage and computing, tracking the package, maintenance and others are detailed in supplementary Specification.

\section{Supplementary Specification}
\subsection{Security}
The system should avoid the database being attacked and data being taken
advantage of by the wicked.
\subsubsection{Access and Data Integrity}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The authorization of access to the system of postmen, customers
  and customer servers should be classified and announced clearly. With
  certain authorization, different users have limited access to data and
  operation.
  \item The server should use anti-virus software.
  \item Firewalls and network protection are necessary, and they should
  be updated in time.
  \item The atomic processes in the database will ensure the accuracy
  of the database.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Encryption}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The session should not be transmitted in DNS.
  \item All texts and messages should be encrypted with Encryption Algorithm
  such as RSA, 3DES or IDEA.
  \item Two keys are used to identify a certain user. One public key is
  used for encryption and anther private key is used for decryption.
  The key is a completely random mix of letters.
  \item The session will record the activity of the customer, and if the
  customer has no operation for 5 minutes, he or she will log out the system
  automatically.
  \item After customers log out the system, all the private information(cookies)
  will be cleaned.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Digital Certificates}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We use digital certificates as a replacement of user names and
  passwords, for example, SSL Certificates. It will be used automatically
  with the permission of users.
  \item The IP address or location where users log in the system will be
  recorded and when the account is used beyond their regular locations, the
  user will get alarmed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Digital Signatures}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Users should log in the system with a password. Our system will
  test its complexity. If it is too simple, the system will remind the
  users to complicate it. That involves cryptography.
  \item We use a message digest to ensure the integrality of the data.
  \item If necessary, we can extend our fingerprint system to login system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The information of the package, including the real-time position,
  Order-ID, the postman etc., should be checked by customers in 3 seconds
  with at most 0.1\% error rate.
  \item The payment should be confirmed in 2 seconds by the system from
  the moment when the third party trade agent sends the message or the
  postmen report the payment.
  \item The order created by customers should be processed in 15 minutes.
  \item The orders obtained from e-business should be processed every
  hour(about 5,000 orders).
  \item Information of the delivery such as the phone number, the address,
  the receiver and others should be updated and checked by postman in 1 min.
  \item This system allows the e-business to create batch orders which can
  be sent at regular time.
  \item The estimate of delivery time should be accurate with the max
  uncertainty in 2 days.
  \item The expectation should be sent to custom service in 2 min from
  the time a postman reports it.
  \item This system’s unavailable time should be controlled in 20 minutes
  in a year.
  \item To offer the best user experience, a content delivery network
  should be used by this system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Storage and Computing}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To store a huge amount of data, distributed database should be used.
  And it should use Homogeneous Distributed Databases Management System.
  \item Considering that there may be an enormous number of visitors and
  inquiries at the same time, the system must implement cloud computing service.
  \item The system can support as many as 1500 times of visits per second.
  \item There must be a copy of the database, including device entity,
  software, data and even employees, in order to prevent some unpredictable
  disasters.
  \item If the database is destroyed, the copy should be enabled in 3 hours.
  \item The data can be in English, Chinese, Japanese, French and Korean.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Track the Package}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In order to track the package, the GIS system should be applied,
  with the help of the GPS system. The system gets geographic information
  from a third party system, and get the position of postmen who deliver
  the package through the system of postmen. And this system should match
  both kinds of the information and show it to users of the system.
  \item The system for postmen should upload the position of the postman
  automatically every 2 hours, through 3G, 4G or WLAN network.
  \item If the locations of postmen are missing for 4 hours, the system
  should inform the custom servers, and custom servers will contact with
  postmen.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Maintenance}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The distributed database should be maintained by the employees
  of our own company including the employees of the standby database
  every day when the visiting traffic is not heavy.
  \item The software for custom service, customer and postmen and the
  system itself should be maintained by our employees.
  \item The geographic information source should be multiple, in case
  that one of the sources is unavailable.
  \item The engineers from the company offered DBMS will maintain
  our system every year.
  \item An integrated scheme to deal accidents, for example, the crash
  of database, is necessary.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Others}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The architectures of the postman app and the customer app are B/S
  and C/S, but that of custom service is C/S for safety.
  \item Our system can be used in iOS and Android on mobile devices and in
  a normal browser on PC(Windows/macOS/Unix).
  \item Anticipated development time is two months.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Analysis}
\section{Architectural Analysis}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=6in]{DocumentRes/PackageDiagram.png}
  \caption{Package Diagram}
\end{figure}
\subsection{System Structure}
The architecture has $5$ layers, which are extended from the 4-tier architecture. We have taken extensibility, code reusability into consideration. $5$ layers are as follows.
\subsubsection{Presentation Layer}
The first layer is Presentation Layer. This layer provides a user interface to translate the logistics information to user friendly representation. It contains Web front-end and iOS app, serving as user's entry of the system. It transfers the information the transport layer and call the API, provided by the transport layer. The layer in out system consists of two subsystems, iOS app and Website. As for the platforms consideration, the website will take advantage of Bootstrap framework, using the language of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The iOS app will use the Cocoa Touch, Media, Core Services and Core OS in the development.
\subsubsection{Service Layer}
The second layer is Service Layer. This layer works as a coordinator of our system. It provides some Application Programming Interface(API) to the Presentation Layer, including Web API, iOS API and external API. The external API provides interfaces to some third-party services, such as Alipay API provides the services for pay via Alipay Account. This layer plays a role of delivering the request from Presentation Layer to Business Logic Layer. We have designed protocols and different frameworks to implement those API, including Spring Web and UIKit.
\subsubsection{Business Logic Layer}
The third layer is Business Logic Layer. This layer contains several controllers including Order Controller, User Controller, Dispatch Management and Third-Party Service. In our system, these controllers will process the data and make package the update UI operation. This layer is one of the part of MVC(Model-View-Controller) framework.
\subsubsection{Data Layer}
The fourth layer is Data Layer. This layer define the data model of our system, including data access and data maintenance. It contains Order Information and User Information which is entity in our database system. In this layer, we will take advantage of different database and handle different type efficiently(e.g. structural and non-structural data). We will use Oracle DBMS and SQL language. For the data access, we will choose the Hibernate and NHibernate framework.
\subsubsection{Domain Layer}
The last layer is Domain Layer. The Domain Layer contains $3$ packages including Order, Customer, Postman. This layer contains the concrete information stored in our system. It provides services for the Business Logic Layer by helping it get concrete information. We separate these information into this independent layer, so that there will be less data redundancy and the efficiency of reading or writing will be improved. This layer is also related with the Data Layer, It needs the service and support of the Data Layer.

\section{Analysis Model}
\subsection{Global Class Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=6in]{DocumentRes/ClassDiagram.png}
  \caption{Global Class Diagram}
\end{figure}
The first part is the domain layer, which contains the User Class, Order Class and Client Class. Thus, Customer and Postman is the subclass of User and implement the method. The User Class records the basic information of a user. User ID is the primary key of Use and User Type is an enum consisting of \textbf{[Customer, Postman, Superuser]}. The user can login the system by email or ID or telephone number and password. In the newly created class, it's instance stores the detailed information of the order, including user's name, phone number, and address. This class is designed as a self-define data type and can be used to compare the information of users stored in our system.\\
The class Customer has a corresponding order list and the attributes to sign the package. The Postman has the attribute ‘region’ to identify the areas where he is in charge of. We define the public API of User to provide services for the controller.\\
The class Order record the basic information of an order. The Order ID is the primary key of Order. Since the sender or the receiver may not register an account in the system, the Order class records the name, Tel number and address of sender and receiver. The class Order is designed for containing information about our orders and all the basic services will be offered by the controller, such as \textbf{[createOrder(), getOrderInfo()]}. When the user tracks the package, System will return the real-time address of the order.\\
The second part is the controller classes. All the requests from UI are sent to the Parser. The Parser provides Order Controller APIs to web UI and app UI. It will parse the request and delivery the request to corresponding controller. The DatabaseController collects the necessary information to record in the database and handles the request and returns the result to UI. For example, when the user tracks the package by using the app UI, the app UI will call the app API and sends the request to Parser then to the OrderController.\\
The third part is the boundary classes containing the UI class. The AppUI provides a lot of functions for users, which is the same with the WebUI.

\subsection{Use Case Realization}
\subsubsection{Scenario One}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/1SequenceDiagram_create.png}
  \caption{Scenario One Sequence Diagram: Create}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/1CommunicationDiagram_create.png}
  \caption{Scenario One Communication Diagram: Create}
\end{figure}
As seen in the communication diagram or sequence diagram, the customer can create order in our order management system. The customer will create order by pressing the corresponding buttons on user interface. After getting the request, user interface will send the request to the parser. Then, the parer send messages to the order controller to create order. The order controller, as seen from its name, will send the creating messages to the class order and control its creation of order, then new order will be created and inserted to database by database controller.

\subsubsection{Scenario Two}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/2SequenceDiagram_check.png}
  \caption{Scenario Two Sequence Diagram: Check}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/2CommunicationDiagram_check.png}
  \caption{Scenario Two Communication Diagram: Check}
\end{figure}
As seen in the communication diagram or sequence diagram, postman can check order information in our order management system. Postman will check order information by pressing the corresponding buttons on user interface. After getting the request, the user interface will send the request to parser by calling the API. The parser will analyze the request and send messages to the order controller. Then the order controller will call database controller to select corresponding order information from database.

\subsubsection{Scenario Three \& Four}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/34SequenceDiagram_signPackage.png}
  \caption{Scenario Three \& Four Sequence Diagram: Sign Package}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/34CommunicationDiagram_signPackage.png}
  \caption{Scenario Three \& Four Communication Diagram: Sign Package}
\end{figure}
The process of signing package is shown as the sequence diagram below. First of all, the postman needs to know information of the customer. As a result, a request of retrieving the order information will be sent by postman. The parser here is to analysis requests from UI and transmit to the controller. Information, including customer's name and phone number, will be returned to the postman. After that, the receiver is supposed to inform the postman her information. In order to verify if she is the designated person or customer herself, a confirmation of customer is required. If so, the receiver will have access to sign the package; otherwise, the demand of signing the package should be rejected.

\subsubsection{Scenario Five}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/5SequenceDiagram_payOnline.png}
  \caption{Scenario Five Sequence Diagram: Pay Online}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/5SequenceDiagram_payOffline.png}
  \caption{Scenario Five Sequence Diagram: Pay Offline}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/5CommunicationDiagram_askInvoice.png}
  \caption{Scenario Five Communication Diagram: Ask Invoice}
\end{figure}
After the customer creates an order, he or she should choose one way to pay for the product, pay online or pay offline. If the customer chooses to pay online, he or she should enter the payment password after confirmed  the order. And the Parser will parse the request and send the password to the third-Party System. Then the third-Party System will response the payment information(success or failed) and the ui will display the payment information.\\
On the other hand, if the customer chooses to pay offline, he or she needs to pay after received the product. The customers pays for the product by cash or by card after checked the amount with the postman. Then the postman submits the money to the logistic company. After the third-Party System or logistic company received the amount, it will transfer money to the E-business.\\
After paid the product, the customer has the opportunity to ask the E-business for an invoice. He or she fills in the address in the app, and then the Parser will parse the request and send the address to the E-business. If the customer wants a paper invoice, he or she needs to pay an extra postage for the invoice. After that, the E-business will send the invoice to the customer.

\subsubsection{Scenario Six}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/6SequenceDiagram_recordDamage.png}
  \caption{Scenario Six Sequence Diagram: Record Damage}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/6CommunicationDiagram_recordDamage.png}
  \caption{Scenario Six Communication Diagram: Record Damage}
\end{figure}
If the package is damaged or lost, the postman records the damages and sends the damages information to the logistic company. Then the logistic company will send an apology  message to the customer. After received the message, the customer can choose to recreate a new order or cancel the order. He or she needs to press the recreate or cancel button in the app, and then the Parser will parse the request and send a signal to the OrderController. After received the signal, the OrderController will execute a function to update or delete the order information in the database.

\subsubsection{Scenario Seven}
\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Scenario Seven Communication Diagram: Return}
\end{figure}
If the customer is unsatisfied with the product, he/she can return the product. Customers need to apply for returning through both App UI and Web UI. Then Parser will recognizes that request and assigns it to OrderController so Order Domain will return a label containing the address to send it back and the postage.\\
If the customer chooses to cancel the order, after a similar process, the order will be completed. Else if he/she chooses to withdraw the order, the original order will be recorded through \textbf{withdrawProduct()} and then be completed.

\subsubsection{Scenario Eight}
\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Scenario Eight Communication Diagram: Track}
\end{figure}
Customers and Customer Service have the right to track the product. Customer will invoke the function on UI. Messages will be sent to Parser in URL link. After parsing the link, Parser invokes the trackPackage function of OrderController. OrderController will then get the location by invoking the function of order entity. After getting the real time address, the system will return this information to the UI who invokes the function.

\subsubsection{User Management Subsystem}
This subsystem offers interface to user to create or modify his informations and was inherited. by Class Customer and Postman.
\begin{lstlisting}
	User createUser(string userName, string password, string email, string telephone, Address address)
\end{lstlisting}
This interface is used to create user via userName, password, email, telephone and address. Once created, it will generate an userId automatically to identify and store the whole user info in database.
\begin{lstlisting}
	User modifyUser(template<T> userInfo)
\end{lstlisting}
This interface is a virtual function implemented by different sub-functions. User can modify his informations through sending the new value of the Class User.

\subsubsection{Package Sign Subsystem}
This subsystem allows customer to interact with controller to finish package signing.
\begin{lstlisting}
	bool signPackage(Customer customerInfo, Order orderInfo)
\end{lstlisting}
This function will be invoked when a receiver wants to sign the package. Information of customer and her order will be sent to back end. A boolean value will be returned as a mark which indicates the status of signing process, that is, success or not.
\begin{lstlisting}
	bool confirmReceiverInfo(Customer receiverInfo, Order orderInfo)
\end{lstlisting}
This interface receives the information of receiver and corresponding order, sends them to customer in order to confirm if the receiver has access to the package. It returns a boolean value that means the verification is successful or not.

\subsubsection{Payment Subsystem}
This subsystem offers interfaces to controller for customers and postmen to finish payment(including package and freight). The corresponding interfaces are as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}
	bool payOnline(string orderNumber, string password)
\end{lstlisting}
This interface is used in the scenario that customers pay online using third-party system(e.g. Alipay) and the third-party will check the payment and return the payment information(successful or failed). If the order and password are right, it will return true and amend the state of the order. Otherwise it will return false.
\begin{lstlisting}
	bool payByCash(string orderNumber, double amount)
\end{lstlisting}
This interface receives the orderNumber and the amount of the order as parameters and return payment information(success or fail). This is used in the receivers pay by cash and postmen check the payment.

\begin{lstlisting}
	Invoice provideInvoice(E-business ebusiness, string orderNumber, InvoiceType type, Address address)
\end{lstlisting}
This interface is used in the scenario that the customers need an invoice. If a customer asks for an invoice, he or she should send the orderNumber, invoice type(paper or digit), and corresponding address to the E-business company. Then the E-business company will return an invoice to the customer.
\begin{lstlisting}
	bool transferAmount(E-business ebusiness, double amount)
\end{lstlisting}
After the logistic company or third-party system received the amount from customers, they need to transfer the amount to the E-business company to finish this order payment.

\subsection{Detailed Subsystem: Order Management}
Our Order Management Subsystem provides some interfaces such as create, selectOrder, insertOrder and so on. The OrderController class require following interfaces. For example, if a customer want to create an order, it will call the createOrder function of Order controller, and then use the create function of Order class interface to create an order and the insertOrder function of Database Controller to insert a new order into the database.\\
As the class diagram shows, our system will get the external order information in the format of Pair from customers and E-business type if it creates orders for E-business. By invoking the interface in orderController class, it will call the create function in order and insertOrder function to insert the data in database.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=6in]{DocumentRes/OrderManagement.png}
	\caption{Class Diagram: Order Management Subsystem}
\end{figure}
This sequence diagram shows the process of creating the order for the customer. After getting the request from the customer, the system will check if the customer already exists in our system. If the customer does exist, the system will add the external order information provided by the customer into our system. And return the result to the customer.\\
This sequence diagram shows the process of creating order list for the E-business. In this subsystem, it will create the order list by creating one single order each time. Until the loop of creating a single order finishes, it will return the whole order list back to the E-business. For creating a single order, the process is the same as creating the order for the customer, as showed above. By checking the existence of the customer, the system will add the new order’s information of the customer.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=6in]{DocumentRes/1SequenceDiagram_create.png}
	\caption{Sequence Diagram: Create}
	\centering\includegraphics[width=6in]{DocumentRes/2SequenceDiagram_check.png}
	\caption{Sequence Diagram: Check}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Protocol}
Mainly we would use TCP/IP (Internet Protocol Suite) and the common four layers: link layer, transport layer, internet layer and application layer.\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Link Layer: We adopt Ethernet and particularly take MAC (Medial Access Control) model in our system.
	\item Transport Layer: We employ IP to ensure the transportation of data and ARP \& RARP as the transformation between IP address and the physical address. In addition, considering our system is used around the regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, we use IGMP to process the trans-regional transportation.
	\item Internet Layer: Because in OrderController, the content is orders, we decided use UDP and through the error handling to ICMP. If the transportation failed, ICMP in Transport Layer will send error message.
	\item Application Layer: In this layer because there is no need to assure real-time communication. Besides, it is unpractical and will cost a lot, we use HTTP/HTTPS.	
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{JSON Format of Order}
\begin{lstlisting}
{
 "orderNumber" : string,
 "orderDate" : string,
 "orderSenderContacts" : {
 	"userID" : string,
 	"userType" : enum,
 	"userName" : string,
 	"email" : string,
 	"telephone" : string,
 	"address" : {
 		"country" : string,

}
\end{lstlisting}

	\centering\includegraphics[width=7in]{DocumentRes/OrderFormat.png}
	\caption{Order Format}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interface between Our System and External Systems}
As shows above, we have designed create order interface for communication between our system and external systems. The external systems include the E-business websites and the customer.\\
The Encryption class provides interfaces for the third party messaging system. These interfaces are showed in the security mechanism.\\

\section{Mechanisms}
\subsection{Communication Mechanism}
Our system provides both AppAPI and WebAPI to the User Interface. The parser will parse the request and forwarding to the OrderController or Third-Party System according to the content. The OrderController will use the interface provided by the Order Class. The communication will be provided by using its interface. The sequence diagram is used to describe the message receiving process of the subsystem's interface. This interface will receive the messages and then create responses, send back to front-end.
\subsection{Security Mechanism}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=6in]{DocumentRes/SecurityMechanism.png}
	\caption{Security Mechanism}
\end{figure}
Our system provides two interfaces in this mechanism and defines two corresponding functions, including encryption and random string generation. There are two entity classes MD5Encrypt and SHAEncrypt which are designed for implementing the interface EncryptBehavior. Inheriting from the abstract class Encryption, the entity class ConcreteRandom is used to implement the RandomBehavior interface and will invoke these two interfaces.\\
Encryption is an abstract class, without the \textbf{encryption} operation and \textbf{randomStr} operation. Thus, two attributes which are two interfaces are private. What is more is that we add a string attribute to store the content, an abstract operation \textbf{init} for subclass to init the text attribute and set algorithm at the beginning, a \textbf{runEncryption} operation to precess the encryption and a \textbf{setAlgorithm} operation to set the algorithm.\\
The sequence diagram of this security mechanism shows the encryption process. The system will generate a string randomly according to the length defined in the Encryption class. The \textbf{encrypt} interface will put together the original password and the random string to complete the encryption, thus, return the encrypted string. This encrypted string is used to identify the user's identity by comparing the input of password with what stores in our database.
\section{Use Case Realizations}
\subsection{Sign the Package}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/34SequenceDiagram_signPackage.png}
	\caption{Sequence Diagram: Sign the Package}
\end{figure}
In this use case, the postman uses his mobile device to let the receiver sign the package. Since the receiver is the generalization of the customer and the third-party agent, we add additional controller: Signature system, to control the signing way: fingerprint. After receiving and parsing the request in the Dispatch Controller from Postman's App UI, it will use the Order Controller to compare the receiver information and use the Signature System to compare the signature or fingerprint with what store in the system. We have defined a series of \textbf{get} functions and corresponding parameters to implement this use case. All the attributes except the orderID are defined as protected, so that the security is guaranteed. We define the signature, fingerprint and order list attribute of the class Customer as private ones to improve security. And the aggregation as well as the relationships such as aggregation, dependency are showed in the class diagram.\\
The postman will get the receiver’s information by using the Postman's App UI. This boundary class will call its interface \textbf{getReceiverInfo()}. The corresponding request will pass through Dispatch Controller, Order Controller and Order class. Each class will call its own interface showed in the class diagram and retrieve the order and receiver information finally. During the signing process, the postman's App UI will call its interface \textbf{signPackage()}. If the package is signed by the agent, the system will identify the information and compare them by using the order controller and calling compareIdentifyInfo(). If the package is to be signed by the customer himself, the customer has alternative choices, including signature and fingerprint. We will submit the signature or fingerprint by calling the interface \textbf{submitSignature()}, provided by the signature system. And pass the corresponding information to the signature service which will compare the signature or fingerprint with what are stored in our system. If the corresponding information are matched with each other, the order controller will call its interface \textbf{confirmDelivery()}. Then the order class will use \textbf{updateStatus()} to complete the package delivery and return success signal to the \textbf{getStatus()} interface.
\subsection{Track the Package}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=4in]{DocumentRes/8SequenceDiagram_track.png}
	\caption{Sequence Diagram: Track the Package}
\end{figure}
The process of signing package is shown as the sequence diagram above. First of all, the postman needs to know information of the customer. As a result, a request of retrieving the order information will be sent by postman. The parser here is to analysis requests from UI and transmit to the controller. Information, including customer's name and phone number, will be returned to the postman. After that, the receiver is supposed to inform the postman her information. In order to verify if she is the designated person or customer herself, a confirmation of customer is required. If so, the receiver will have access to sign the package; otherwise, the demand of signing the package should be rejected.\\
When the Customer and the Customer Service track the package by using the Customer's App UI or Web UI, the UI will call the API implemented by dispatch controller and send the Request by the HTTP. The request contains the order id and the content-type is JSON. The parser parses the request and sends the order id to Order Controller. Order Controller gets the order information from the database. And if the order exists, Order Controller will get the location info of the order and sends it to the Address Controller. The Address Controller will get the addresses from the location information by a loop and put them in an order list. This process will come to an end when the prelocationid is null. After this process, the Address Controller return the Address list to the customer.\\
After invoking the interfaces parseWebRequest(URL url, JSON info) and parseAppRequest(URL url, JSON info) of Dispatch Controller, the system will get the tracking request from the customer or the customer service. It will use the getOrderFromDB(String ordered) provided by the Order Controller to get the package, required to track by the customer or the customer service. If the package exists in the database, it will invoke the getAddress() and getPreLocation() interfaces to get the current and former addresses of the package by its order id. Then the system will return the Address list to the customer or the customer service.

	\centering\includegraphics[width=3in]{DocumentRes/database3.png}
\end{figure}\\
In order to realize extendibility and reusability, the encryption mechanism of our system is designed be using the strategy pattern. We have defined 2 interfaces, which are encryption behaviors and generation of random string. An abstract class Encryption is defined and its method is designed for implementing the 2 interfaces. We may define a class inherited from the Encryption class and define the two interfaces in detail. In our prototype, we design two concrete class, named as MD5Encrypt and SHAEncrypt. And 2 other concrete classes are defined for the generation of random string and encryption of the password. The detailed test is in the test file.\\
The source code is showed in the compressed package.
